class ProtocolHttpRequestBuilder(Protocol):
    """
    Protocol for building complex HTTP requests with fluent interface.

    Supports query parameters, form data, file uploads, authentication,
    and other advanced HTTP features through method chaining.

    Example:
        ```python
        # Implementation example (not part of SPI)
        # All methods defined in the protocol contract must be implemented

        # Usage in application
        builder: "ProtocolHttpRequestBuilder" = get_request_builder()

            .with_bearer_token("token123") \
            .with_file_upload({"document": file_bytes}) \
            .post()

        # Alternative: Form data submission
        response = await builder.url("https://api.example.com/submit") \
            .with_form_data({"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}) \
            .with_header("X-Request-ID", "req-123") \
            .post()

        # Alternative: Basic authentication
        response = await builder.url("https://api.example.com/protected") \
            .with_basic_auth("username", "password") \
            .with_timeout(30) \
            .get()
        ```

    Request Building Patterns:
        - Fluent interface for method chaining
        - Support for query parameters, form data, and JSON payloads
        - Multiple authentication methods (bearer token, basic auth)
        - File upload capabilities for multipart requests
        - Custom headers and timeout configuration
        - All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)

    Key Features:
        - Type-safe request building with validation
        - Streaming support for large file uploads
        - Authentication abstraction with multiple strategies
        - Request timeout and retry configuration
        - Header management with proper validation
        - Integration with ONEX security patterns

    Security Considerations:
        - Secure handling of authentication credentials
        - Validation of file upload types and sizes
        - Protection against header injection attacks
        - URL validation to prevent SSRF

    for efficient processing of large data sets.

    Example:

        # All methods defined in the protocol contract must be implemented

        # Usage in application

            process_small_response(full_content)

    Streaming Patterns:
        - Binary content streaming with configurable chunk sizes
        - JSON lines (ndjson) streaming for structured data
        - Text line streaming for text-based responses
        - Full content access for smaller responses
        - Metadata access (status, headers, URL)

    Key Features:
        - Memory-efficient streaming for large responses
        - Support for multiple content formats (binary, JSON, text)
        - Configurable chunk sizes for optimal performance
        - Proper encoding handling for text content
        - Access to standard HTTP response metadata

    Performance Considerations:
        - Streaming prevents loading large responses into memory
        - Chunk size can be optimized based on use case
        - Backpressure support for rate-limited processing
        - Proper resource cleanup on cancellation

    Error Handling:
        - Connection errors during streaming
        - Content encoding validation
        - Chunk boundary handling
        - Stream interruption recovery
