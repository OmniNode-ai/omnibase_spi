ONEX HTTP Client Protocol

This protocol defines the interface for HTTP client implementations in the ONEX architecture.
Used by EFFECT nodes that need to make external HTTP requests, particularly for webhook
and notification systems.

Security Note: Implementations must include SSRF protection and validate all target URLs.
