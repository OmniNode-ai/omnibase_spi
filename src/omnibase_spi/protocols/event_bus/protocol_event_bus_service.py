    """Protocol for event bus service lifecycle and cluster management.

    Defines the standard interface for event bus service implementations providing
    lifecycle management, cluster coordination, and service health monitoring across
    distributed ONEX deployments.

    This protocol ensures consistent service behavior including graceful startup/shutdown,
    cluster topology management, and runtime status monitoring for production reliability.

    Example:
        ```python
        from omnibase_spi.protocols.event_bus import ProtocolEventBusService

        # Initialize event bus service
        service: ProtocolEventBusService = create_event_bus_service(
            broker_config={"bootstrap.servers": "kafka1:9092,kafka2:9092"}
        )

        # Access event bus for messaging
        event_bus = await service.get_event_bus()
        await event_bus.publish(
            topic="events",
            key=b"key",
            value=b"data",
            headers={"correlation_id": "abc-123"}

            print(f"Cluster: {node_count} nodes - {nodes}")

        # Graceful shutdown
        service.shutdown()
        ```

    Key Features:
        - Event bus instance management and lifecycle
        - Graceful startup and shutdown coordination
        - Cluster topology discovery and monitoring
        - Service health status tracking
        - Resource cleanup and connection management
        - Runtime configuration access

    Lifecycle Stages:
        1. Initialization: Service created with configuration
        2. Running: Event bus active, accepting operations
        3. Shutdown: Graceful cleanup, connection closure
        4. Terminated: All resources released

    Cluster Management:
        - Node discovery and health monitoring
        - Topology changes detection
        - Load balancing across nodes
        - Failover coordination

    Provides lightweight event bus adapter for services that connect to external

    for serverless functions, edge computing, and language-agnostic integrations.

    This adapter pattern supports event bus integration without requiring native
    Kafka/Redpanda client libraries, enabling broader deployment scenarios.

        - Health monitoring and connection management
        - Subscription lifecycle management

    Use Cases:
        - Serverless functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
        - Edge computing nodes
        - Polyglot microservices
        - Browser-based applications
        - Environments with restricted network protocols
        - Development and testing scenarios

    Transport Mechanisms:
        - Publish: HTTP POST with event payload
        - Subscribe: HTTP long polling or webhooks
        - Health: HTTP GET for status checks
