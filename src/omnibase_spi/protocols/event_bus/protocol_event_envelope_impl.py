DEPRECATED: Event Envelope Protocol Implementation

This file has been deprecated as it violates SPI purity principles:
- Contains concrete implementation class (SPI007 violation)
- Imports from omnibase_core.models (SPI012 violation)
- Implementations should be in omnibase-core, not omnibase-spi

Use the protocol interfaces from:
- omnibase_spi.protocols.onex.protocol_onex_envelope
- omnibase_spi.protocols.onex.protocol_onex_validation

This file will be removed in a future release.
