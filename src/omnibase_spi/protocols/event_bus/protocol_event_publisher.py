class ProtocolEventPublisher(Protocol):
    """
    Protocol for event publishers with reliability features.

    Defines contract for publishing events with:
    - Retry logic with exponential backoff
    - Circuit breaker to prevent cascading failures
    - Event validation before publishing
    - Correlation ID tracking
    - Dead letter queue (DLQ) routing
    - Metrics tracking

    Implementations must provide:
    - Kafka/Redpanda event publishing
    - Automatic retries with configurable backoff
    - Circuit breaker state management
    - DLQ routing on persistent failures
    - Performance metrics

    Example:
        ```python
        from omnibase_spi.protocols.event_bus import ProtocolEventPublisher

        # Get publisher implementation
        publisher: ProtocolEventPublisher = create_event_publisher(
            bootstrap_servers="redpanda:9092",
            service_name="my-service",
            instance_id="instance-123"
        )

        # Publish event
        success = await publisher.publish(
            event_type="omninode.my_domain.event.something_happened.v1",
            payload={"key": "value"},
            correlation_id="correlation-123"
        )

        # Get metrics
        metrics = publisher.get_metrics()
        print(f"Published: {metrics['events_published']}")

        # Clean shutdown
        await publisher.close()
        ```

    Circuit Breaker:
        Opens after threshold failures, preventing additional publish attempts.
        Automatically resets after timeout period or successful publish.

    Dead Letter Queue:
        Failed events (after max retries) are routed to DLQ topics with error metadata.
        Topic naming: {original_topic}.dlq
