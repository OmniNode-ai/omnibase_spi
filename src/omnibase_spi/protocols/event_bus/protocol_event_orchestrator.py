    Protocol for event orchestration and workflow coordination in ONEX systems.

    This protocol defines the interface for coordinating events between distributed
    services, managing agent lifecycle, and handling work distribution with strict
    SPI purity compliance.

    Key Features:
        - Agent lifecycle management (spawn, terminate, health monitoring)
        - Work ticket assignment and load balancing
        - Event-driven coordination with async patterns
        - Comprehensive error handling and recovery
        - Performance metrics and monitoring

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        # Protocol usage example (SPI-compliant)
        orchestrator: ProtocolEventOrchestrator = get_orchestrator()

        # Handle work ticket creation
        ticket: "ProtocolWorkTicket" = create_work_ticket()
        success = await orchestrator.handle_work_ticket_created(ticket)

        # Monitor agent health
        health_status = await orchestrator.monitor_agent_health()
        for agent_id, status in health_status.items():
            print(f"Agent {agent_id}: {status}")

        # Subscribe to orchestration events
        async for event in orchestrator.subscribe_to_orchestration_events():
