    Protocol for ONEX contract objects.

    Defines the interface for contract objects in the ONEX distributed system,
    including identification, versioning, metadata management, and serialization.
    Contracts define behavioral agreements between system components.

    Key Features:
        - Unique contract identification
        - Semantic versioning support
        - Extensible metadata dictionary
        - Bidirectional serialization (to/from dict)

    Usage:
        contract = get_contract()
        contract_id = contract.contract_id
        version = contract.version
        metadata = contract.metadata

        # Serialization
        contract_dict = contract.to_dict()

        # Deserialization
        restored_contract = ContractImpl.from_dict(contract_dict)
