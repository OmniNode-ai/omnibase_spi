Protocol for file writing operations.

This protocol defines the interface for writing files to various storage systems.
Implementations can write to filesystem, S3, memory, etc.

    """
    Protocol for file writing operations in ONEX ecosystem.

    Defines the contract for file writing operations with support for
    multiple storage backends and atomic operations. Enables dependency
    injection and test isolation through protocol-based design.

    Key Features:
        - Single file writing with path flexibility
        - Batch file writing with atomic operations
        - Directory creation and management
        - File deletion operations
        - Protocol-based design for testability
        - Multiple storage backend support

    Supported Storage Backends:
        - FileSystemFileWriter: Local filesystem operations
        - MemoryFileWriter: In-memory file operations for testing
        - S3FileWriter: Amazon S3 cloud storage operations
        - FTPFileWriter: FTP server file operations
        - EncryptedFileWriter: Secure file writing with encryption

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        writer: ProtocolFileWriter = SomeFileWriter()

        # Write single file
        path = writer.write_file('config.yaml', yaml_content)

        # Write multiple files atomically
        files = [
            ('config/database.yaml', db_config),
            ('config/cache.yaml', cache_config),
            ('config/logging.yaml', log_config)
        ]
        written_paths = writer.write_files(files)

        # Ensure directory exists
        config_dir = writer.ensure_directory('config')

        # Delete file
        deleted = writer.delete_file('old_config.yaml')
        ```

    Integration Patterns:
        - Works with ONEX configuration management
        - Integrates with file processing pipelines
        - Supports dependency injection for testing
        - Compatible with validation and stamping workflows
        - Provides atomic operations for consistency
