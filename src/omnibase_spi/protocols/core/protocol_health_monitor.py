    """
    Protocol for standardized health monitoring across ONEX services.

    Provides consistent health check patterns, monitoring configuration,
    and availability tracking for distributed system reliability.

    Key Features:
        - Multi-level health checks (quick to comprehensive)
        - Dimensional health assessment (availability, performance, etc.)
        - Configurable monitoring intervals and thresholds
        - Health metrics collection and trending
        - Automated alerting and escalation
        - Service dependency health tracking

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        # Protocol usage example (SPI-compliant)
        service: "HealthMonitor" = get_health_monitor()

        # Usage demonstrates protocol interface without implementation details
        # All operations work through the protocol contract
        # Implementation details are abstracted away from the interface

        health_monitor: "ProtocolHealthMonitor" = HealthMonitorImpl()

        health_status = health_monitor.perform_health_check(
            level="standard",
            dimensions=["availability", "performance"]
        )
        ```
