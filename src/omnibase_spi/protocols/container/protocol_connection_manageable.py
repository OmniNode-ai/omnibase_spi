    """
    Protocol for comprehensive connection management across ONEX services.

    Provides consistent connection lifecycle management, health monitoring,
    reconnection strategies, and resilient connection handling for distributed
    system reliability and fault tolerance.

    Key Features:
        - Connection lifecycle management (connect, disconnect, close)
        - Real-time connection status monitoring and health checks
        - Automatic reconnection with configurable retry strategies
        - Connection pool management and resource optimization
        - Graceful degradation and circuit breaker patterns
        - Connection metrics collection and performance monitoring
        - Event-driven connection state notifications
        - SSL/TLS security configuration and validation

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        # Protocol usage example (SPI-compliant)
        service: "ConnectionManageable" = get_connection_manageable()

        # Usage demonstrates protocol interface without implementation details
        # All operations work through the protocol contract
        # Implementation details are abstracted away from the interface

        connection_mgr: "ProtocolConnectionManageable" = DatabaseConnectionManager()

        # Establish connection with retry
        success = await connection_mgr.establish_connection()
        if not success:
            await connection_mgr.reconnect_with_strategy(retry_config)

        # Monitor connection health
        if await connection_mgr.perform_health_check():
            # Connection is healthy, proceed with operations
            pass
        else:
            # Connection unhealthy, trigger recovery
            await connection_mgr.recover_connection()
        ```

    Connection States:
        - disconnected: No active connection established
        - connecting: In process of establishing connection
        - connected: Active connection ready for operations
        - reconnecting: Attempting to restore lost connection
        - failed: Connection failed and requires intervention
        - closing: Gracefully shutting down connection

    Reconnection Strategies:
        - immediate: Attempt reconnection without delay
        - exponential_backoff: Exponentially increasing delays between attempts
        - linear_backoff: Linear delay increases for predictable retry timing
        - circuit_breaker: Temporary connection suspension after failure threshold
        - manual: Require explicit reconnection request (no auto-retry)

    Health Check Levels:
        - ping: Basic connectivity test (fastest)
        - shallow: Basic query or lightweight operation
        - deep: Comprehensive connection validation and feature check
        - diagnostic: Full connection diagnostics with performance metrics
