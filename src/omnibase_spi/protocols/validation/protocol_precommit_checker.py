Protocol interface for pre-commit checker tools in ONEX ecosystem.

This protocol defines the interface for pre-commit checker tools that validate
code quality, SPI purity, and compliance before commits. Provides type-safe
contracts for consistent checking behavior across different validation types.

    Protocol for pre-commit check results.

    Defines the contract for validation results from pre-commit checking operations.

class ProtocolPrecommitChecker(Protocol):
    """
    Base protocol for pre-commit checker tools in ONEX ecosystem.

    Defines the interface for pre-commit checker tools that validate code quality,
    SPI purity, and compliance before commits. Provides consistent checking behavior
    across different validation types with comprehensive result reporting.

    Key Features:
        - File and directory validation
        - Batch processing support
        - Detailed violation reporting
        - Integration with CI/CD pipelines
        - Configurable validation rules
        - Performance optimization

    Supported Validation Types:
        - SPI purity validation (namespace isolation, protocol compliance)
        - Code quality checks (style, formatting, best practices)
        - Security validation (vulnerability scanning)
        - Performance analysis (bottleneck detection)
        - Documentation validation (completeness, accuracy)

    Usage Example:
        ```python
        checker: ProtocolPrecommitChecker = SomePrecommitChecker()

        # Check multiple files
        files_to_check = [str('src/main.py'), str('tests/test_main.py')]
        result = checker.check_files(files_to_check)

        if result.has_violations():
            print(f"Found {result.get_violation_count()} violations")
            # Handle violations
            handle_violations(result.violations)

        # Check single file
        single_result = checker.check_single_file(str('config.yaml'))
        ```

    Integration Patterns:
        - Works with ONEX validation framework
        - Integrates with git pre-commit hooks
        - Supports CI/CD pipeline integration
        - Provides detailed violation reporting
        - Compatible with async processing patterns
