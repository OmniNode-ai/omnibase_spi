# Script Logic Bug Fixes Report

## Summary

Fixed 4 critical logic bugs across 3 forward reference fixer scripts that were preventing proper multi-type handling, import alias tracking, and fix counting.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug 1: Multi-type Replacement (fix_forward_references.py:140-201)

**Problem**: When a line had multiple forward reference types, only the last one was being quoted.

**Example Issue**:
```python
def foo(x: TypeA, y: TypeB) -> TypeC:  # Only TypeC would be quoted
```

**Root Cause**: The script was breaking after the first match and storing the original line for each fix separately, causing subsequent fixes to overwrite previous ones.

**Fix**: Refactored `_find_unquoted_usages()` to:
- Build the updated line incrementally instead of per-type
- Apply all type fixes to the same line before storing
- Track all fixed types in a comma-separated list
- Only create one `ForwardReferenceFix` per line with all changes

**Verification**:
```python
# Input:  def foo(x: TypeA, y: TypeB) -> TypeC:
# Output: def foo(x: "TypeA", y: "TypeB") -> "TypeC":
✓ All 3 types correctly quoted
```

### Bug 2: Import Alias Tracking (2 files)

#### Bug 2a: fix_forward_references.py (lines 73-104, 114-138)

**Problem**: `from x import Foo as Bar` only tracked "Foo", missing "Bar" in usage scanning.

**Root Cause**: AST extraction only added `alias.name`, ignoring `alias.asname`.

**Fix**:
- **AST method**: Track both `alias.name` and `alias.asname` (if exists)
- **Regex fallback**: Parse "as" statements and add both original and alias names

```python
# Before
for alias in child.names:
    type_checking_imports.add(alias.name)

# After
for alias in child.names:
    type_checking_imports.add(alias.name)
    if alias.asname:
        type_checking_imports.add(alias.asname)
```

#### Bug 2b: comprehensive_forward_ref_fix.py (lines 26-84)

**Problem**: Same issue in comprehensive fixer.

**Fix**: Applied identical fixes to both AST and regex extraction methods.

**Verification**:
```python
# Input:  from omnibase_spi.protocols.types import ProtocolEvent as Event
#         def handle(e: Event) -> None:
# Output: def handle(e: "Event") -> None:
✓ Alias "Event" correctly tracked and quoted
```

### Bug 3: Fix Counter (fix_double_quotes.py:14-33)

**Problem**: Counter reported 0 fixes because it counted AFTER writing the file (patterns already replaced).

**Root Cause**:
```python
content = re.sub(pattern1, r'"\1"', content)  # Modify content
file_path.write_text(content)                 # Write modified content
fixes = len(re.findall(pattern1, file_path.read_text()))  # Count on modified file = 0
```

**Fix**: Use `re.subn()` which returns `(new_string, count)` tuple:
```python
content, count1 = re.subn(pattern1, r'"\1"', content)
content, count2 = re.subn(pattern2, r'"\1"', content)
total_fixes = count1 + count2
if total_fixes > 0:
    file_path.write_text(content)
return total_fixes
```

**Verification**:
```python
# Input:  def foo(x: ""TypeName"") -> ""TypeName"":
#             var: ""TypeName"" = None
# Output: Reported 3 fixes (accurate count)
✓ Counter correctly reports 3 fixes
```

## Testing

Created comprehensive test suite (`test_script_fixes.py`) with 4 test cases:

1. **test_multi_type_replacement**: Verifies all types on same line get quoted
2. **test_import_alias_tracking**: Verifies both original and alias names are tracked (AST)
3. **test_fix_counter_accuracy**: Verifies `re.subn()` returns accurate count
4. **test_comprehensive_fixer_alias**: Verifies comprehensive fixer handles aliases

**Test Results**: ✓ All 4 tests passed

## Impact

These fixes ensure:
- ✅ Multi-type function signatures are fully quoted
- ✅ Import aliases (e.g., `as Bar`) are properly tracked and quoted
- ✅ Fix counters report accurate numbers for validation and reporting
- ✅ Scripts can be run multiple times without introducing new errors

## Files Modified

1. `scripts/fix_forward_references.py` (3 methods)
   - `_extract_type_checking_imports()` - Added alias tracking
   - `_extract_type_checking_imports_regex()` - Added alias parsing
   - `_find_unquoted_usages()` - Incremental line building

2. `scripts/comprehensive_forward_ref_fix.py` (2 methods)
   - `extract_type_checking_imports()` - Added alias tracking
   - `_extract_type_checking_imports_regex()` - Added alias parsing

3. `scripts/fix_double_quotes.py` (1 function)
   - `fix_double_quotes_in_file()` - Use `re.subn()` for counting

## Validation

```bash
# Run all tests
python test_script_fixes.py

# Result:
Passed: 4/4
Failed: 0/4
✓ All tests passed!
```

## Next Steps

1. Run updated scripts on codebase to fix remaining forward references
2. Verify no regressions in existing fixed files
3. Clean up test file (can be removed after validation)
