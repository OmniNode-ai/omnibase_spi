## Risk Register

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|-------|
| Import cycles | Medium | High | Use TYPE_CHECKING, forward refs | All tracks |
| Merge conflicts | High | Medium | Coordinate on memory domain | Tracks 3-6 |
| Protocol signature changes | Low | Critical | Rename only, no signature changes | All tracks |
| Missing canonical modules | Low | Medium | Analyze before removing duplicates | Tracks 4-6 |
| Documentation scope creep | High | Medium | Set clear tier priorities | Track 8 |
| Agent coordination issues | Medium | Medium | Use tracking sheet, clear checkpoints | Coordinator |

## Commands Quick Reference

### Start tracking
```bash
# Mark checkpoint as complete
sed -i 's/⬜/✅/' REMEDIATION_TRACKING.md

# Update metric
# Manually edit the current value in tables
```

### Validation commands
```bash
# Check current violations
python scripts/validation/comprehensive_spi_validator.py src/ --json-report

# Count by rule
python -c "
import json
with open('comprehensive_spi_validation_*.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    violations = data['violations']
    from collections import Counter
    rules = Counter(v['rule_id'] for v in violations)
    for rule, count in sorted(rules.items()):
        print(f'{rule}: {count}')
"

# Calculate quality score
python -c "
import json
with open('comprehensive_spi_validation_*.json', 'r') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
    print(f\"Quality Score: {data['summary'].get('quality_score', 'N/A')}%\")
"
```

### Update tracking
```bash
# Get latest metrics after validation
python scripts/update_tracking.py  # (Create this helper script)
```
