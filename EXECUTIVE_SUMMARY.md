## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|------------|-------|
| **Import Cycles** | Use TYPE_CHECKING guards, forward references | All tracks |
| **Merge Conflicts** | Coordinate on memory domain, incremental integration | Tracks 3-6 |
| **Documentation Scope Creep** | Clear tier priorities, phased approach | Track 8 |

### Dependencies

- **Track 7** depends on **Tracks 3-6** (protocol consolidation)
- **Tracks 4-6** coordinate on memory domain (overlap)
- **Track 8** runs independently (no blockers)

## Execution Workflow

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Review planning documents
cat SPI_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md
cat AGENT_SPAWN_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# 2. Run baseline validation
python scripts/validation/comprehensive_spi_validator.py src/ --json-report

# 3. Spawn 8 parallel agents (Tracks 1-6 for Phase 1)
# Each agent follows instructions in AGENT_SPAWN_INSTRUCTIONS.md

# 4. Monitor progress
python scripts/update_tracking.py

# 5. Integrate after Phase 1
git checkout -b feature/spi-integration
# Merge tracks 1-6...

# 6. Run final validation
python scripts/validation/comprehensive_spi_validator.py src/ --json-report
```

### Integration Process

```bash
# Phase 1 Integration (after tracks 1-6)
git checkout -b feature/spi-integration
git merge feature/spi-track-1-async-fix
git merge feature/spi-track-2-core-conflicts
git merge feature/spi-track-3-agent-conflicts
git merge feature/spi-track-4-memory-conflicts-1
git merge feature/spi-track-5-memory-conflicts-2
git merge feature/spi-track-6-memory-conflicts-3

# Validate Phase 1
python scripts/validation/comprehensive_spi_validator.py src/ --json-report
# Expected: 0 errors, <346 warnings

# Phase 2 Integration (after track 7)
git merge feature/spi-track-7-semantic-duplicates

# Validate Phase 2
python scripts/validation/comprehensive_spi_validator.py src/ --json-report
# Expected: 0 errors, <100 warnings

# Final validation before merge to main
poetry run mypy src/omnibase_spi --strict
poetry run pytest
poetry build
```

## Communication Protocol

### Status Updates

**Daily Standup** (during active execution):
- Track completion status
- Blocker identification
- Coordination needs

**Integration Checkpoints**:
1. After Track 1-6 completion → Integration branch created
2. After Track 7 completion → Quality improvements merged
3. After Track 8 Phase 1 → Documentation policy approved

### Escalation Path

- **Technical Issues**: Track owner → Remediation coordinator
- **Merge Conflicts**: Coordinate with overlapping tracks (especially 3-6)
- **Scope Changes**: Remediation coordinator → Stakeholders
